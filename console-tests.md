## Introduction

In addition to simplifying HTTP testing, Laravel provides a simple API for testing your application's [custom console commands](/docs/{{version}}/artisan).

## Success / Failure Expectations

To get started, let's explore how to make assertions regarding an Artisan command's exit code. To accomplish this, we will use the `artisan` method to invoke an Artisan command from our test. Then, we will use the `assertExitCode` method to assert that the command completed with a given exit code:

    /**
     * Test a console command.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function test_console_command()
    {
        $this->artisan('inspire')->assertExitCode(0);
    }

You may use the `assertNotExitCode` method to assert that the command did not exit with a given exit code:

    $this->artisan('inspire')->assertNotExitCode(1);

Of course, all terminal commands typically exit with a status code of `0` when they are successful and a non-zero exit code when they are not successful. Therefore, for convenience, you may utilize the `assertSuccessful` and `assertFailed` assertions to assert that a given command exited with a successful exit code or not:

    $this->artisan('inspire')->assertSuccessful();

    $this->artisan('inspire')->assertFailed();

## Input / Output Expectations

Laravel allows you to easily "mock" user input for your console commands using the `expectsQuestion` method. In addition, you may specify the exit code and text that you expect to be output by the console command using the `assertExitCode` and `expectsOutput` methods. For example, consider the following console command:

    Artisan::command('question', function () {
        $name = $this->ask('What is your name?');

        $language = $this->choice('Which language do you prefer?', [
            'PHP',
            'Ruby',
            'Python',
        ]);

        $this->line('Your name is '.$name.' and you prefer '.$language.'.');
    });

You may test this command with the following test which utilizes the `expectsQuestion`, `expectsOutput`, `doesntExpectOutput`, and `assertExitCode` methods:

    /**
     * Test a console command.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function test_console_command()
    {
        $this->artisan('question')
             ->expectsQuestion('What is your name?', 'Taylor Otwell')
             ->expectsQuestion('Which language do you prefer?', 'PHP')
             ->expectsOutput('Your name is Taylor Otwell and you prefer PHP.')
             ->doesntExpectOutput('Your name is Taylor Otwell and you prefer Ruby.')
             ->assertExitCode(0);
    }

#### Confirmation Expectations

When writing a command which expects confirmation in the form of a "yes" or "no" answer, you may utilize the `expectsConfirmation` method:

    $this->artisan('module:import')
        ->expectsConfirmation('Do you really wish to run this command?', 'no')
        ->assertExitCode(1);

<a name="table-expectations"></a>
#### Table Expectations

If your command displays a table of information using Artisan's `table` method, it can be cumbersome to write output expectations for the entire table. Instead, you may use the `expectsTable` method. This method accepts the table's headers as its first argument and the table's data as its second argument:

    $this->artisan('users:all')
        ->expectsTable([
            'ID',
            'Email',
        ], [
            [1, 'taylor@example.com'],
            [2, 'abigail@example.com'],
        ]);
