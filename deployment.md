## Introduction

When you're ready to deploy your Laravel application to production, there are some important things you can do to make sure your application is running as efficiently as possible. In this document, we'll cover some great starting points for making sure your Laravel application is deployed properly.

<a name="server-requirements"></a>
## Server Requirements

The Laravel framework has a few system requirements. You should ensure that your web server has the following minimum PHP version and extensions:

<div class="content-list" markdown="1">

- PHP >= 8.0
- BCMath PHP Extension
- Ctype PHP Extension
- cURL PHP Extension
- DOM PHP Extension
- Fileinfo PHP Extension
- JSON PHP Extension
- Mbstring PHP Extension
- OpenSSL PHP Extension
- PCRE PHP Extension
- PDO PHP Extension
- Tokenizer PHP Extension
- XML PHP Extension

</div>

<a name="server-configuration"></a>
## Server Configuration

<a name="nginx"></a>
### Nginx

If you are deploying your application to a server that is running Nginx, you may use the following configuration file as a starting point for configuring your web server. Most likely, this file will need to be customized depending on your server's configuration. **If you would like assistance in managing your server, consider using a first-party Laravel server management and deployment service such as [Laravel Forge](https://forge.laravel.com).**

Please ensure, like the configuration below, your web server directs all requests to your application's `public/index.php` file. You should never attempt to move the `index.php` file to your project's root, as serving the application from the project root will expose many sensitive configuration files to the public Internet:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    server_name example.com;
    root /srv/example.com/public;

    add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN";
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff";

    index index.php;

    charset utf-8;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
    }

    location = /favicon.ico { access_log off; log_not_found off; }
    location = /robots.txt  { access_log off; log_not_found off; }

    error_page 404 /index.php;

    location ~ \.php$ {
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.0-fpm.sock;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $realpath_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        include fastcgi_params;
    }

    location ~ /\.(?!well-known).* {
        deny all;
    }
}
```

## Optimization

<a name="autoloader-optimization"></a>
### Autoloader Optimization

When deploying to production, make sure that you are optimizing Composer's class autoloader map so Composer can quickly find the proper file to load for a given class:

```shell
composer install --optimize-autoloader --no-dev
```

> **Note**  
> In addition to optimizing the autoloader, you should always be sure to include a `composer.lock` file in your project's source control repository. Your project's dependencies can be installed much faster when a `composer.lock` file is present.

<a name="optimizing-configuration-loading"></a>
### Optimizing Configuration Loading

When deploying your application to production, you should make sure that you run the `config:cache` Artisan command during your deployment process:

```shell
php artisan config:cache
```

This command will combine all of Laravel's configuration files into a single, cached file, which greatly reduces the number of trips the framework must make to the filesystem when loading your configuration values.

> **Warning**  
> If you execute the `config:cache` command during your deployment process, you should be sure that you are only calling the `env` function from within your configuration files. Once the configuration has been cached, the `.env` file will not be loaded and all calls to the `env` function for `.env` variables will return `null`.

<a name="optimizing-route-loading"></a>
### Optimizing Route Loading

If you are building a large application with many routes, you should make sure that you are running the `route:cache` Artisan command during your deployment process:

```shell
php artisan route:cache
```

This command reduces all of your route registrations into a single method call within a cached file, improving the performance of route registration when registering hundreds of routes.

<a name="optimizing-view-loading"></a>
### Optimizing View Loading

When deploying your application to production, you should make sure that you run the `view:cache` Artisan command during your deployment process:

```shell
php artisan view:cache
```

This command precompiles all your Blade views so they are not compiled on demand, improving the performance of each request that returns a view.

<a name="debug-mode"></a>
## Debug Mode

The debug option in your config/app.php configuration file determines how much information about an error is actually displayed to the user. By default, this option is set to respect the value of the `APP_DEBUG` environment variable, which is stored in your application's `.env` file.

**In your production environment, this value should always be `false`. If the `APP_DEBUG` variable is set to `true` in production, you risk exposing sensitive configuration values to your application's end users.**
