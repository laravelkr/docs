## Introduction

Laravel includes a simple to use rate limiting abstraction which, in conjunction with your application's [cache](cache), provides an easy way to limit any action during a specified window of time.

### Cache Configuration

Typically, the rate limiter utilizes your default application cache as defined by the `default` key within your application's `cache` configuration file. However, you may specify which cache driver the rate limiter should use by defining a `limiter` key within your application's `cache` configuration file:

    'default' => 'memcached',

    'limiter' => 'redis',

## Basic Usage

The `Illuminate\Support\Facades\RateLimiter` facade may be used to interact with the rate limiter. The simplest method offered by the rate limiter is the `attempt` method, which rate limits a given callback for a given number of seconds.

The `attempt` method returns `false` when the callback has no remaining attempts available; otherwise, the `attempt` method will return the callback's result or `true`. The first argument accepted by the `attempt` method is a rate limiter "key", which may be any string of your choosing that represents the action being rate limited:

    use Illuminate\Support\Facades\RateLimiter;

    $executed = RateLimiter::attempt(
        'send-message:'.$user->id,
        $perMinute = 5,
        function() {
            // Send message...
        }
    );

    if (! $executed) {
      return 'Too many messages sent!';
    }

### Manually Incrementing Attempts

If you would like to manually interact with the rate limiter, a variety of other methods are available. For example, you may invoke the `tooManyAttempts` method to determine if a given rate limiter key has exceeded its maximum number of allowed attempts per minute:

    use Illuminate\Support\Facades\RateLimiter;

    if (RateLimiter::tooManyAttempts('send-message:'.$user->id, $perMinute = 5)) {
        return 'Too many attempts!';
    }

Alternatively, you may use the `remaining` method to retrieve the number of attempts remaining for a given key. If a given key has retries remaining, you may invoke the `hit` method to increment the number of total attempts:

    use Illuminate\Support\Facades\RateLimiter;

    if (RateLimiter::remaining('send-message:'.$user->id, $perMinute = 5)) {
        RateLimiter::hit('send-message:'.$user->id);

        // Send message...
    }

#### Determining Limiter Availability

When a key has no more attempts left, the `availableIn` method returns the number of seconds remaining until more attempts will be available:

    use Illuminate\Support\Facades\RateLimiter;

    if (RateLimiter::tooManyAttempts('send-message:'.$user->id, $perMinute = 5)) {
        $seconds = RateLimiter::availableIn('send-message:'.$user->id);

        return 'You may try again in '.$seconds.' seconds.';
    }

### Clearing Attempts

You may reset the number of attempts for a given rate limiter key using the `clear` method. For example, you may reset the number of attempts when a given message is read by the receiver:

    use App\Models\Message;
    use Illuminate\Support\Facades\RateLimiter;

    /**
     * Mark the message as read.
     *
     * @param  \App\Models\Message  $message
     * @return \App\Models\Message
     */
    public function read(Message $message)
    {
        $message->markAsRead();

        RateLimiter::clear('send-message:'.$message->user_id);

        return $message;
    }
